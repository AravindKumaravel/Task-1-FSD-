1) Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2?

	HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol, and it is the basis for almost all web applications. HTTP is the method computers and servers use to request and send information.

What is HTTP/1.1?

	It is the first usable version of HTTP was created in 1997. It went through several stages of development and  this is the first version of HTTP was called HTTP/1.1. This version is still in use on the web.


What is HTTP/2?
	A newerr version of HTTP called HTTP/2 was created. HTTP/2 solves several problems that the creators cannot able to sole in  HTTP/1.1 . In particular, HTTP/2 is much faster and more efficient than HTTP/1.1. One of the ways in which HTTP/2 is faster is in how it prioritizes content during the loading process.


								Difference

Multiplexing:

       HTTP/1.1 can only handle one request per connection at a time, leading to head-of-line blocking issues. HTTP/2, on the other hand, supports multiplexing, allowing multiple requests          and responses to be sent and received on the same connection simultaneously. This significantly improves efficiency, especially for websites with many resources.


Binary Protocol: 

	HTTP/2 is a binary protocol, while HTTP/1.1 is text-based. The binary format of HTTP/2 is more efficient and reducing overhead and improving performance.


Header Compression:
 
	HTTP/1.1 sends headers in plain text with each request and response, leading to redundant data transfer. HTTP/2 compresses headers, reducing overhead and improving latency.


Server Push: 

	HTTP/2 supports server push, where the server can push resources to the client before they are requested. This can reduce the number of round trips needed to load a webpage,improving performance.


Prioritization: 

	HTTP/2 allows clients to prioritize requests, specifying which resources are more important. This enables more efficient resource allocation and can improve the perceived performance of a website.





					              Object in javascript




Define Object in javascript?

	 An object is a collection of key-value pairs where each key is a unique identifier and each value is any JavaScript data type, including other objects. Objects in JavaScript can be thought of as containers for storing related data and functionality.



	let details = {
	name = "Aravind";
	age = 24;
	City = "Puduchcherry";
	course = "Full stack developement";
	}

	where in this details is an object "name,age,city,course" are the four propertis and also they have theri key-value pairs.



Internal Representation in javascript?

	The internal representation in javascript in an object an contain a mix of primitive data type such a 	
	
	> Numbers
	> Srtings
	> Booleans
	> Null
	> Undefined
	> Symbols

 

	> JavaScript objects are often implemented using hash table. Each property of the object is stored as a key-value pair in the hash table, where the key is the property name and the value is a reference to the property's value or function.

	> We can access properties using dot notation or bracket notation

	let details = {
	name = "Aravind";
	age = 24;
	City = "Puduchcherry";
	course = "Full stack developement";
	}


	Eg: console.log(details.name);
